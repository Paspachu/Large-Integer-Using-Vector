# Large-Integer-Using-Vector

This repository includes the header file that defines large integer in vector form.

In header file, the following operators are defined:

(1) +, addition

(2) -, subtraction

(3) *, multiplication

(4) /, division

(5) %, modulus

There are also following functions:

(1) int to vector: change int (long/ long long) to vector with one digit in each index starting from the ones digit.

(2) vector to int: change vector to int (long/ long long) with first index representing the ones.

(3) print: it prints out vector like int (long/ long long).

I believe that this header file allows you to compute integers with up to 2^30 digits.
